### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

>My name is Jonathan Fillipe Lemes, from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I've been working with programming since 2015, when I started my first IT course. I'm currently studying Computer Science at Federal University of ItajubÃ¡ (UNIFEI).
>Me and some friends started a software development startup during college, BlackFex, currently with two major products: FrogBot (a day trade bot with a user friendly interface) and Kalass (a mobile app that allows students from our university to manage their classes and provides chats to integrate our users).

ðŸ’»ðŸ—º Would you like to find me?
